#### createFactory

The `createFactory` API can be used to create element factories and additionally provides an interface to create client renderers that can target different platforms/targets.

#### Children.find

The `Children.find` API works like the `Array.find` API in that it allows you find a single element from the opaque children data-structure.

#### Children.filter

The `Children.filter` API works like the `Array.filter` API in that it allows you filter elements from the opaque children data-structure.

#### Reconciler Improvements

The reconciler has gone through some improvments that aim to insure the shorterst path is taken to reach a reconciled state.

#### Import(...)

This release includes improvements to the way(syntax sugar) you can dynamically import components.

```js
// A.js
export default class {
	render() {}
}
```

```js
// Before
class {
	render() {
		return import('./A.js').then(A => A.default)
	}
}

// After
class {
	render() {
		return import('./A.js')
	}
}
```

## 8.0.0 (06 October 2017)

### Overview

- Support `componentDidCatch`.
- Support `stateful` functional components.
- Support rendering fragments.
- Support rendering [Iterables](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Iterators_and_Generators).
- Support [EventListener](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/EventListener) interface.
- Support `context`, getChildContext.
- Support strings refs for functional components.
- Support an opaque data-structure for `props.children`
- Support mounting to top-level `html` element.
- Support out of order server side rendering with portals.
- Adds top-level API `createPortal`.
- Adds top-level API `findDOMNode`.
- Adds top-level API `hydrate`.
- Adds top-level API `Children`.
- Adds top-level API `unmountComponentAtNode`
- Adds invarient errors for `render` if target container is invalid.

### Breaking Changes.

- `componentDidThrow` is renamed to `componentDidCatch` and unmounts the DOM if an error state is left unhandled. However errors coming from event handlers are exluded from this behaviour.

- `props.children` is now an opaque data-structure, which might break your application if you relied on it always being of an `Array` type.

- Passing an invalid object to `#render` as the container to render to will throw an error. Falsey values are not considered invalid values, these will fallback to the `root` Node in a DOM tree. Truethy values that are not of or do not extend/mimic the native `Node` class of the platform would be considered invalid.

- Hydration now exists soley as an explicit API `hydrate`.

- Hydration will now always try to make sure the DOM matches the virtual elements generated on the client. This may result in removing nodes or adding DOM nodes. This only bears any meaning if the server and client renders do not match in which case the reconciler will always try to make the DOM match what you render on the client.

lifecycles on functional components, new architecture to support pausing and resuming tree
updates and more.

### API

```js
// client side
{
	render,
	createElement,
	h,
	Component,
	version
}

// server side
{
	...,
	shallow
}
```

#### renderToString

renderToString is supplimented by `h(..).toString()` in a server enviroment which means we could just do this `${h(..)}`

#### renderToStream

renderToStream is supplimented by `dio.render` which also supports rendering to a writable stream
on the server like the Node.js `Response` object and `h(..).toStream()`, `dio.render` however also handles streaming json responses and will set the correct MIME type if one hasn't been set.
